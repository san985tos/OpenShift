Install operator:
  OpenShift GitOps
  
Instal ArgoCD CLI:
  curl -sSL -o /usr/local/bin/argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/argocd
  mv /usr/local/bin/argocd /usr/local/sbin/

Review installation:
  oc get operators
  oc get pods -n openshift-gitops
  

Connecting to the Argo CD Server:
  oc get routes -n openshift-gitops | grep openshift-gitops-server | awk '{print $2}'
  
Find the default password for the admin account as follows:
  oc extract secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops --to=-

To login from the terminal, execute the following (replace $ARGOCD_SERVER_URL with the above URL):
  argocd login $ARGOCD_SERVER_URL

  You can login with the following:
  Username: admin
  Password:

Verify that you're connected to the Argo CD API server by running the following:
  argocd cluster list

  This output lists the clusters that Argo CD manages. In this case in-cluster in the NAME field signifies that Argo CD is managing the cluster it's installed on.
  NOTE You can connect multiple clusters for Argo CD to manage!

To enable bash completion, run the following command:
  source <(argocd completion bash)

Note:
  The Argo CD CLI stores it's configuration under ~/.argocd/config
  NOTE The argocd cluster add command used the ~/.kube/config file to establish connection to the cluster.



Deploying a Sample Application
   
The Application CR (CustomResource) can be applied by running the following:
  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/main/components/applications/bgd-app.yaml

At this point the application should be up and running. You can see all the resources created with the command:
  oc get pods,svc,route -n bgd

First wait for the rollout to complete:
  oc rollout status deploy/bgd -n bgd

Then visit your application using the route by navigating to the URL under the "HOST/PORT" column:
  oc get route -n bgd

Let's introduce a change! Patch the live manifest to change the color of the box from blue to green:
  oc -n bgd patch deploy/bgd --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"green"}]'

Wait for the rollout to happen:
  oc rollout status deploy/bgd -n bgd

If you refresh your tab where your application is running you should see a green square now.

Looking over at your Argo CD Web UI, you can see that Argo detects your application as "Out of Sync".

You can sync your app via the Argo CD by:

First clicking SYNC
Then clicking SYNCHRONIZE
Conversely, you can run

argocd app sync bgd-app
