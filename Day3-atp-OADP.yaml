Day3-atp-OADP


## Step 1 - set up storage backend

Create a Bucket on AWS

Create Secret from cloud file
╰─○ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n openshift-adp --from-file cloud=./cloud 

Validate the secret on the project
╰─○ oc get secrets -n openshift-adp

Create the Data Protection Application Custom Resource
╰─○ Login into OpenShift console
╰─○ Select openshift-adp project
╰─○ Go to Home > Operators > Installed Operators
╰─○ Select OADP operator


Create a Data Protection Application from YAML:
╰─○ From ATP Document

Review the installation and verify it is successfully completed.
╰─○ watch oc get all -n openshift-adp



## Step 2 - Make a  stateless app Backup

Deploy a stateless application
╰─○ oc create -f nginx-deployment.yaml 

Review the app on the console

Review the YAML nginx-stateless-backup.yaml

Execute yaml
╰─○ oc create -f nginx-stateless-backup.yaml 

Wait and review the backup is finished
╰─○ oc get backup -n openshift-adp nginx-stateless -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}' 
╰─○ oc get backup -n openshift-adp nginx-stateless -o yaml 

Delete the nginx-example project
╰─○ oc delete namespace nginx-example
╰─○ oc get project nginx-example


## Step 3 - Restore the stateless app

Create a restore custom resource definition to recover the application
╰─○ oc create -f nginx-stateless-restore.yaml 
╰─○ oc get restore -n openshift-adp nginx-stateless -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'


Review the recovered application
╰─○ oc get project nginx-example
╰─○ oc get all -n  nginx-example



## Step 4 - stateful app backup


Deploy a persistent application (from same directory from previous exercise)
╰─○ oc create -f mssql-template-2.yaml 

Wait and validate the application is deployed correctly
╰─○ oc get all -n mssql-persistent 

Check the created PV and PVC
╰─○ oc get pvc -n mssql-persistent

Visit the application through the OpenShift console.

Show how to create an application backup this time on the console.
  > On OpenShift console
  > Select openshift-adp project
  > Go to Home > Operators > Installed Operators
  > Select OADP operator
  > Select backup


Click “create backup”
  > Name: backup-atp1
  > Check Include Cluster Resources
  > Include Namespaces: mssql-persistent
  > Check Snapshots volumes
  > Click create


Crate the stateful backup
╰─○ oc create -f mssql-backup.yaml  
╰─○ oc get backup -n openshift-adp mssql-persistent -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}' 


## Step 5 - stateful app restore
Delete the application
╰─○ oc delete project  mssql-persistent

Delete pv used for the application.
╰─○ oc get pv
╰─○ oc delete pv mssql-persistent

Create a Restore
╰─○ oc create -f mssql-restore.yaml 
╰─○ oc get restore -n openshift-adp mssql-persistent -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}' 

Verify all resources have been recreated in the restore process
╰─○ oc get all -n mssql-persistent
